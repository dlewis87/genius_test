This is the thing that got me on the stage. This got me to tour all around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly it showed me a true definition of what being an artist was.\n\nFrom the jump I thought it was about the accolades and the cars and the clothes. But its really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what Im saying? Hip-hop has done that for me.\n\nI got a lot of guys in this building right now that I still idolize to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These guys showed me the game through their lyrics, from close and from afar.\n\nSo with that being said, this trophy to hip-hop, real talk. Thats love, baby. Jay for president!\n\n'"

Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, thats how it go.\n\n\nOn the Grammys snubbing him entirely\n\nI definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because its music as a whole, its not just splitting different regions.

130,"b'\n\nOn the response to the line ""Im the king of New York"":\n\nIt made me go back here and feel like I probably gotta dumb down my lyrics nowadays, for people to take it way out of context the way they did The main heads that really understood the context of the line was the actual kings of New York, the cats that I sat down with this past week. Theyre not understanding that its not about the culture, its not about what side we on, its about being great as Biggie, as Pac, the two cats that I referenced I feel like Im a student. Im a student of the work that they did. When I put down 20 years in the game, I can eventually plant my foot and have that same type of legacy I never take the history behind what Pac laid or what BIG laid.\n\nOn Kendricks king of rap, Snoop Dogg:\n\nTo keep it 100 with you, Snoop will always be number one, and Im from the West Coast, and he gave me that. But out of respect for my big homie, I understand it. He laid down. I only got one album out homie. One album out. I got years to be doing this. At the end of the day, Snoop will always be my big homie and the legends that came before me they will always stand tall where theyre at. But I cant stop myself from wanting to be great just like them.\n\nOn East/West rivalry in 2013:\n\nI feel as though you have certain cats that are really gonna take it to the next level and make it a rivalry thing and try to bring back that whole thing. No thats old school homie. We black men out here trying to uplift the culture. My first sold out show was in New YorkI respect the legends in the game. I respect people that done it before me, people that lost their lives over this. Because of what they laid down, Im gonna try to go ten times harder and breathe it and live it. Thats the point of the whole verse, what I was trying to convey through that verse. All the ignorance behind it, you can kill that noise. Itll never be like that again, two coast rivalry.

This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That\'d said album of the year, that\' said album of this generation and all that shit. That\'s cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy.

I\'m a low-key nigga. And I ain\'t scared of the world. Me personally, I can\'t run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don\'t need to, I don\'t want to. And that\'s just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can\'t cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, ""I need to be me goddamnit"". I think this shit can live forever, but looking at y\'all faces y\'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y\'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y\'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I\'m saying? Some shit that yall can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I\'m saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit.

172,"b'\n\nReminder that you can click the images for more annotations.\n\nEvery member of rap\'s Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminembut it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latestand possibly greatestrapper to come straight outta Compton.\n\n\nWe are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents\' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.\n\nIt turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his ""little bro""a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick\'s parents\' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.\n\nSo today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City\'s fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn\'t sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he\'s telling me about Chad. ""It all happened when I was overseas,"" he says. ""I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed.""\n\nIt\'s been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerdsone of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers everand since then his legend has spread fast.\n\nIt actually began late last year, when Kendrick\'s major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The albumabout a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom\'s minivan chasing ""that crazy-ass girl Sherane""is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap\'s violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He\'s the game\'s most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realestthe one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude\'s houseand it\'s this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you\'re putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West CoastBeach House samples, Dungeon Family lushnessbut throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along They\'d probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean\'s song ""Control""a guest spot on a song that didn\'t even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself ""the king of New York,"" which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.\n\n""Control"" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.\n\nKendrick\'s career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton\'s memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it ""back to the set"" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. ""It can be complicated and confusing,"" Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. ""From my perspective, it\'s not just I\'m famousI still live in this world."" And when someone back home needs something, ""I still gotta get that phone call.""\n\nIt\'s clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.\n\nA bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: ""When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn\'t mean real life will follow."" Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: ""Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.""\n\n\nOn the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over ""Control"" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn\'s Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on ""Control,"" and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake\'s VMA performance of ""Hold On, We\'re Going Home,"" Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. ""You watch,"" he joked, ""I\'m going to be singing by my fifth album!""\n\nI asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. ""Pretty cool."" Shrugs. ""And I mean, I would be okay if we weren\'t.""\n\nA month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake\'s new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the ""Control"" thing: ""You can\'t just say that and then see me and be like, \'Yeah, man, what\'s up?\'pretending like nothing ever happened."" Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped ""Control"" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.\n\nI got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy\'s public lash-out""Control"" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. ""Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis,"" Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn\'t look up to Drake, doesn\'t see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, ""Nopeer. If anything. We all peers.""\n\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he\'s not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.\n\n""I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom\'s couch. I\'m 26 nowit wasn\'t that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I\'m not huge on superstition and all that shit. That\'s what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, \'Don\'t let the music die.\' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he\'s right there. Just a silhouette.""\n\nThe visit from Pac changed Kendrick\'s connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. ""It wasn\'t just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin\',"" he explains. ""I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there\'s people out there that can\'t really connect to that lifestyle. They\'re in the struggle.""\n\nMuch of Kendrick\'s music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household\'s chaossome of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Comptonand over his neighborhood\'s warped commitment to adolescent pride. It\'s an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn\'t smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. ""When I ask OGs why there\'s so much division in the streetsnobody never really knows,"" he says. ""But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.""\n\nA few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick\'s hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick\'s Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, ""Aw, man, I can\'t go to no club.""\n\nKendrick spoke up.\n\n""We have to go.""\n\n""Look at you! We have to go. You\'re never we have to go.""\n\n""You know me,"" Kendrick explained. ""I only go when there\'s a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the \'Control\' verse? That\'s a point!""\n\nTwenty minutes later, Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith, basically TDE\'s Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. ""You guys seem so calm,"" I said.\n\n""Well,"" Tiffith told me, ""we\'re going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand.""\nThe gossip from Diddy\'s Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-\'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminatiJay, Beymouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the ""King of New York"" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick\'s head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. ""It was all love at that party,"" he told me on the private jet.\n\nAfter we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenn Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: ""We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas.""\n\nBy the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There\'s chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for ""Swimming Pools (Drank),"" a song about his family\'s dark relationship with chemical dependencyHead shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANKa wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.\n\nIt\'s hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg\'s booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. ""I don\'t know,"" he says. ""It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I\'ll be, or how happy I\'ll be, or how confused I\'ll be.""\n\nAt one point on good kid Kendrick raps, ""I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous"". The biggest change in Kendrick\'s life is the inversion of rap\'s consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he\'s already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.\n\n'"

in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine\'s\nDoesnt mean I cant respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I dont know, Im no mortal man\nMaybe Im just another nigga\nShit and thats all I wrote\nI was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but, it aint really a poem\nI just felt like its something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\n\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThats how I see it, my word is bond\nI seeand the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n\'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what Im saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what Im saying, its gonna be like\nYou know what I\'m saying, it\'s gonna be...\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I\'m saying?\n\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody thats rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\n\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin, I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what Im saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow its time to make millions for myself, you know what Im saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\n\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\n\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true""\nRight\nYou know what Im saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what Im saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo its no problem, you know\nI mean, its a problem but Im not finna let them know\nIm finna go straight through\n\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\n\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity Ive ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, its been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what Im saying, its in my veins to fight back\n\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n""We fighting a war, Im fighting a war I cant win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down""\n\nIn this country, a black man only have like\n5 years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd thats right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n\'Cause once you turn 30 its like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you dont wanna fight no more\nAnd if you dont believe me, you can look around\nYou dont see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers\n\nThats crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nTheres nothing but turmoil goin on so, I wanted ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\n\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin\' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it\'s a riot it\'s gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I dont think America know that\nI think American think we was just playing\nAnd its gonna be some more playing but\nIt aint gonna be no playing\nIts gonna be murder, you know what Im saying?\nIts gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what Im saying, its gonna happen\n\nThats crazy man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people dont understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I dont know what type of energy Ima push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\n\nBecause it\'s spirits, we aint even really rappin\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\n\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIts actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\nThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHes trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same""\nWhats your perspective on that?\nPac? Pac? Pac?!\n\n'"
